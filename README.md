# DDoS-Attack-Detection

The proposed system is capable of classifying DDoS attacks as benign and malignant and also achieves high accuracy (97.6%). A total of 865893 rows and 4 features (after feature selection) are used for training and testing the models. The same system, when trained and fitted on a dataset without feature selection, achieves an accuracy higher than 99%, which ultimately may be an absolute indicator of overfitting. Five different algorithms (Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine Classifier, Neural Networks, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes) are employed for classification and their performances are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.
